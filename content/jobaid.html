        <span class="h1">Priority Entitlements and Appointments</span></h1>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="note"><p><span><strong>REMEMBER!</strong></span> <span>The Public Service Commission (PSC) Appointment Policy requires that deputy heads:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li>consider and assess persons with a priority entitlement before considering other candidates</li>
    <li>respect requirements to administer priority entitlements as set out in the <a class="external" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/services/information-priority-administration/priority-administration-directive.html" target="_blank">Priority Administration Directive</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Priority entitlements apply to all organizations subject to the <span>Public Service Employment Act</span>.</li>
    <li>Persons with a priority entitlement may demonstrate interest (self-refer) to be considered to any job being staffed or about<br>
        to be staffed.</li>
    <li>Appointments of persons with a priority entitlement are not subject to recourse.</li>
    <li>Areas of selection in an appointment process do not apply to persons benefiting from a priority entitlement, even if the area of selection includes an employment equity (EE) requirement; however, if the appointment is made under an EE program, the person with the priority entitlement must meet that criterion.</li>
    <li>Persons with a priority entitlement who are considered part of the area of selection in an internal appointment process<br>
        can file a complaint to the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board of Canada, whether they were evaluated or not.</li>
    <li>Even if they are not in the area of selection, persons with a priority entitlement have other recourses such as requests for investigation by the Public Service Commission or complaints to the Canadian Human Rights Commission.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why hire a person with a priority entitlement?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Deputy heads recognize that there is both a legal and a corporate responsibility to assist indeterminate employees and former members of the Canadian Armed Forces, the RCMP or surviving spouses in coping with a change in life or employment.</li>
    <li>It is one of the fastest ways to staff a position.</li>
    <li>Persons with a priority entitlement need only meet the essential qualifications and the conditions of employment; in many cases they can simply be deployed.</li>
    <li>Many persons with a priority entitlement have a corporate memory and are already adapted to federal government and departmental cultures.</li>
    <li>Many persons with a priority entitlement have a shorter learning curve than new public servants and have completed the required and mandatory training in the areas of values and ethics, creating and maintaining a respectful workplace, health<br>
        and safety, financial and HR delegations, and more.</li>
</ul>

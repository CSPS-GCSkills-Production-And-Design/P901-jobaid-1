			<h1>What Managers Need to Know About</h1>
			<h2>Priority Entitlements and Appointments</h2>
			<p><span>REMEMBER!</span> <span>The Public Service Commission (PSC) Appointment Policy requires that deputy heads:</span></p>
			<p><span>•&#9;consider and assess persons with a priority entitlement before considering other candidates</span></p>
			<p><span>•&#9;respect requirements to administer priority entitlements as set out in the</span> <span>Priority Administration Directive</span></p>
			<p>Key Points:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Priority entitlements apply to all organizations subject to the <span>Public Service Employment Act</span>.</li>
				<li>Persons with a priority entitlement may demonstrate interest (self-refer) to be considered to any job being staffed or about<br>
				to be staffed.</li>
				<li>Appointments of persons with a priority entitlement are not subject to recourse.</li>
				<li>Areas of selection in an appointment process do not apply to persons benefiting from a priority entitlement, even if the area of selection includes an employment equity (EE) requirement; however, if the appointment is made under an EE program, the person with the priority entitlement must meet that criterion.</li>
				<li>Persons with a priority entitlement who are considered part of the area of selection in an internal appointment process<br>
				can file a complaint to the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations and Employment Board of Canada, whether they were evaluated or not.</li>
				<li>Even if they are not in the area of selection, persons with a priority entitlement have other recourses such as requests for investigation by the Public Service Commission or complaints to the Canadian Human Rights Commission.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Why hire a person with a priority entitlement?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Deputy heads recognize that there is both a legal and a corporate responsibility to assist indeterminate employees and former members of the Canadian Armed Forces, the RCMP or surviving spouses in coping with a change in life or employment.</li>
				<li>It is one of the fastest ways to staff a position.</li>
				<li>Persons with a priority entitlement need only meet the essential qualifications and the conditions of employment; in many cases they can simply be deployed.</li>
				<li>Many persons with a priority entitlement have a corporate memory and are already adapted to federal government and departmental cultures.</li>
				<li>Many persons with a priority entitlement have a shorter learning curve than new public servants and have completed the required and mandatory training in the areas of values and ethics, creating and maintaining a respectful workplace, health<br>
				and safety, financial and HR delegations, and more.</li>
